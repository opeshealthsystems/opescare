        # OpesCare

        > OpesCare is a patient-centred digital health identity and
        > interoperability platform for Cameroon, built multi-country and
        > bilingual (English and French). Patients hold one portable Health ID
        > and one longitudinal medical record that travels between facilities
        > under their consent.

        ## What OpesCare is

        OpesCare is health infrastructure, not hospital software. It connects
        the systems healthcare facilities already run — it does not require any
        facility to replace its existing software. A hospital keeps its own HIS
        and connects over an API; a facility with no system at all uses a
        browser portal called OpesCare Lite.

        ## What OpesCare is not

        OpesCare is not a hospital management system, an electronic medical
        record product, a billing or accounting system, or an insurance claims
        platform. Those remain the responsibility of each facility's own
        software.

        ## Core capabilities

        - **Health ID** — a portable, verified digital health identity owned by the patient.
        - **Master Patient Index** — resolves one person to one record across facilities, with uncertain matches sent to human review rather than merged automatically.
        - **Consent and access control** — every exchange of patient data is checked against a consent grant, scoped and time-limited, and recorded in a log the patient can read.
        - **Emergency access** — a limited break-glass profile when consent cannot be obtained, requiring a stated reason and notifying the patient.
        - **Interoperability** — HL7 FHIR R4, a REST Connect API, SDKs for PHP, TypeScript and Python, an embeddable widget, webhooks, and an on-premises Bridge Agent for legacy systems.

        ## Network services

        - **Medicine Finder** — search pharmacies on the network for medicine availability, with the timestamp of the last report shown on every listing.
        - **Blood Finder** — search connected hospitals and blood banks by blood group and component.
        - **Care Map** — a directory of healthcare facilities listed in Cameroon's national health facility registry (MINSANTE).
        - **Appointments** — cross-facility booking and referral-linked scheduling.

        ## Key facts

        - Operates in Cameroon first, aligned with MINSANTE regulations, and designed for multi-country expansion.
        - Every screen, notification and document exists in both English and French.
        - Standards: HL7 FHIR R4, OAuth 2.0, SMART-style scopes.
        - The Care Map directory is sourced from Cameroon's national health facility registry (MINSANTE). Listing in the directory records that a facility appears in that registry; it is not an OpesCare accreditation, inspection or licence check.
        - Availability information is reported by facilities and timestamped. It is information to act on, never a guarantee of physical stock.
        - OpesCare never makes clinical decisions. It does not determine transfusion compatibility, diagnose, or recommend treatment.
