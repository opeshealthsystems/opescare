/**
 * Patient Health ID Verification Status
 *
 * Represents the verification lifecycle of a patient's Health ID,
 * tracking how far their identity has been confirmed by the system
 * or a clinical authority.
 *
 * DB column: patients.verification_status (string)
 * Lifecycle:  provisional → pending → verified
 *                                  ↘ suspended / deceased / entered_in_error
 *                                  ↘ merged (duplicate absorbed)
 *                                  ↘ erasure_pending (data subject right exercised)
 *                                  ↘ expired (ID past validity date)
 *
 * MINSANTE: Active Health IDs must be in 'verified' or 'verified_by_facility'.
 * Any other status blocks the patient from appearing in facility searches.
