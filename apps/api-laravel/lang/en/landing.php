    | The homepage answers five questions and nothing more: what OpesCare is,
    | why it matters, how it works, what you can connect, and what to do next.
    | Anything that teaches a workflow, documents a module or sells to one
    | stakeholder belongs on its own page — see the Solutions, Network,
    | Interoperability and Trust pages.
