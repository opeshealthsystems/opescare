            <p>We process your personal and health data on the following legal grounds, consistent with Cameroon Law No. 2010/012 and internationally recognised data protection principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explicit Consent (Article 46, Law 2010/012):</strong> For all non-emergency access to your clinical records, processing is based on your freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent, recorded electronically within the OpesCare platform and timestamped in an immutable audit log.</li>
                <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> Processing necessary to create and maintain your OpesCare Health ID, authenticate your identity, and fulfil obligations under our Terms of Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Vital Interest / Public Health Emergency:</strong> In a verified, life-threatening emergency where you are unable to consent, a limited emergency health profile may be accessed by an approved healthcare provider. This constitutes a vital-interest basis as recognised under international health data protection frameworks. Every such access is strictly audited.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Where we are required to process or disclose data to comply with an order of a competent Cameroonian court, the National Agency for Information and Communication Technologies (ANTIC), or a lawful directive from MINSANTE.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Platform Security &amp; Audit):</strong> Processing necessary for fraud prevention, platform security monitoring, and the maintenance of immutable audit logs, provided this does not override your fundamental rights.</li>

            <h2 id="sharing">5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Authorised Healthcare Providers</h3>
            <p>We share your health records only with healthcare facilities and providers you have explicitly authorised through the OpesCare consent system. Each consent grant specifies the facility, the purpose, the scope of data accessible, and the duration. Providers receive only the minimum data necessary for the stated clinical purpose (<em>data minimisation principle</em>).</p>

            <h3>5.2 Emergency Access</h3>
            <p>In a documented life-threatening emergency, an approved healthcare provider may access your emergency health profile (identity, blood group, critical allergies, active chronic conditions) without prior consent. This access is automatically logged, an alert is sent to compliance officers, and you or your emergency contact are notified at the earliest opportunity. See Section 10 for the full emergency access protocol.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Sub-Processors</h3>
            <p>We engage third-party sub-processors for hosting, backup, and security monitoring. All sub-processors are bound by data processing agreements (DPAs) requiring equivalent data protection standards. We do not use sub-processors established in jurisdictions that do not provide adequate data protection without implementing appropriate safeguards (Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent). Our sub-processors are reviewed annually.</p>

            <h3>5.4 Public Health and Government Authorities</h3>
            <p>We may share <strong>aggregated, de-identified</strong> data with MINSANTE, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and other public health bodies for disease surveillance, epidemiological reporting, health system planning, and to support the objectives of Cameroon's National Digital Health Strategy 2026–2030. No individual patient record is shared for this purpose.</p>

            <h3>5.5 Legal Compliance</h3>
            <p>We will disclose personal data where required by a binding and lawful order of a Cameroonian court, ANTIC, MINSANTE, or other competent regulatory authority. We will, where permitted by law, notify you of any such request prior to disclosure.</p>

            <h3>5.6 What We Will Never Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell, rent, or trade your personal or health data to any third party for commercial purposes.</li>
                <li>Use your identifiable health data for advertising, profiling, or marketing purposes.</li>
                <li>Share your data with insurers, employers, or government agencies outside lawful clinical and regulatory channels without your explicit consent.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clinical health records:</strong> Minimum 10 years from the date of last clinical encounter, consistent with Cameroon health legislation and WHO recommendations. Records relating to minors are retained until the patient reaches 28 years of age, or 10 years from last encounter, whichever is later.</li>
                <li><strong>Audit and access logs:</strong> Minimum 10 years. Audit logs are immutable and cannot be deleted even at the patient's request, as they form part of the legally required accountability framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent records:</strong> For the full duration of the data subject's registration and at least 5 years thereafter, or as required by applicable law.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity data:</strong> For the duration of platform registration and up to 7 years after account closure to satisfy legal obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform usage / authentication logs:</strong> 2 years, for security purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon expiry of these periods, or upon lawful erasure request, data is securely destroyed using cryptographic erasure and/or physical deletion from all storage systems, including backups.</p>

                <li>Sensitive diagnostic categories (including HIV status, mental health records, reproductive health, and substance dependency) are subject to additional access controls and are not included in emergency profiles unless clinically critical.</li>
                <li>We implement the principle of <em>least privilege</em>: each provider role receives access only to the data categories relevant to their clinical function.</li>
                <li>All special category data processing is documented in our Article 30-equivalent Record of Processing Activities (ROPA), available to ANTIC upon request.</li>

            <p>OpesCare may process health records for minors (persons under 18 years of age in the Republic of Cameroon). The following safeguards apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consent for the registration and health data processing of a minor must be provided by a parent or lawfully appointed guardian.</li>
                <li>Access to a minor's health record requires explicit authorisation from the parent/guardian, except in verified medical emergencies.</li>
                <li>Guardians may designate a transition date for patient majority, after which the patient gains full independent control of their Health ID and consent management.</li>
                <li>Records for minors are retained until the patient reaches 28 years of age or 10 years from the date of last clinical encounter, whichever is later, consistent with Cameroon health documentation standards.</li>
                <li>We do not knowingly register minors on the patient-facing portal without verified parental or guardian consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In life-threatening clinical emergencies, where a patient is unconscious or unable to provide informed consent, an approved healthcare provider registered on the OpesCare platform may access a strictly limited <strong>Emergency Health Profile</strong>. This profile contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full legal name and date of birth</li>
                <li>Blood group and Rh factor</li>
                <li>Active critical allergies and contraindications</li>
                <li>Current chronic conditions material to emergency treatment</li>
                <li>Active critical medications</li>
                <li>Emergency contact name and phone number</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every emergency access event:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requires the accessing provider to document a clinical reason before the profile is displayed</li>
                <li>Generates an immediate high-priority audit alert visible to facility compliance officers and platform administrators</li>
                <li>Is logged with the provider's authenticated identity, facility, timestamp, and device</li>
                <li>Triggers an automatic notification to the patient's registered contact at the earliest safe opportunity</li>
                <li>Is subject to post-event review by the relevant facility's clinical governance team</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Emergency access does <strong>not</strong> grant access to the patient's full clinical history, mental health records, reproductive health data, or consent logs.</p>
