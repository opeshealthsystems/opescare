# OpesCare — Module Architecture Guide

OpesCare is a national digital health-ID and interoperability platform (Laravel 13 / PHP 8.3 / PostgreSQL, queue on Redis + Horizon). Its domain logic lives in **46 modules** under `app/Modules/`, each a self-contained set of Models + Services, surfaced through web portals (`/portals/*`) and a versioned API (`/api/v1/*`, `/api/mobile/*`).

This guide groups the 46 into **7 domains**. The first five form the **patient journey**; the last two are **cross-cutting** layers that every domain above depends on.

## 1 · Identity & Access

*Who you are, and who is allowed to see your record.* This domain is the trust root of the whole platform — every clinical read/write is gated here.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Patient] -->|enrol| PI[PatientIdentity]
  PI -->|CM-HID-… issued| MPI[MasterPatientIndex]
  MPI -->|dedupe / link records| REC[(Unified record)]
  U[User] --> AU[Auth]
  AU -->|MFA verified| AC[AccessControl]
  AC -->|role + emergency rules| REC
  REC -->|requires patient OK| CM[ConsentManagement]
  CM -->|grant / deny / revoke| REC
```

### Auth
- **Purpose:** Authentication + two-factor (TOTP/SMS) verification for all human users.
- **Importance:** First gate; `mfa.verified` middleware protects every portal. Without it, no protected route is reachable.
- **Services:** `TwoFactorService`.
- **Main flow:** login → password check → if MFA enabled, challenge → `EnsureTwoFactorVerified` marks the session verified → portal access granted.

### AccessControl
- **Purpose:** Role/permission enforcement and **break-glass emergency access** to records.
- **Importance:** Lets a clinician reach a record in an emergency *with* a full audit trail, instead of being blocked or going around the system.
- **Services:** `EmergencyAccessService`.
- **Main flow:** clinician requests emergency access → reason captured → time-boxed grant created → every read logged → reviewed afterwards by Security Ops.

### PatientIdentity
- **Purpose:** Issues and resolves the national health ID (`CM-HID-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`).
- **Importance:** The unique key that ties a person to their records across every facility — the product's core promise.
- **Services:** `PatientIdentityService`.
- **Main flow:** registration → demographics validated → health ID generated (country-prefixed) → QR/card issued → resolvable by any connected facility.

### MasterPatientIndex
- **Purpose:** Cross-facility patient matching, linking and de-duplication (MPI).
- **Importance:** Stops one person becoming five different records across hospitals — essential for a *national* record.
- **Services:** `MasterPatientIndexService`.
- **Main flow:** incoming patient → probabilistic match against the index → link / merge / create → identifiers reconciled.

### ConsentManagement
- **Purpose:** Patient consent grants, denials, revocations and scoped data-sharing.
- **Importance:** Legal + ethical backbone — a facility can only pull a record the patient (or a valid emergency rule) authorises.
- **Services:** `ConsentManagementService`.
- **Main flow:** facility requests access → patient approves/denies in their portal → `ConsentGrant` with scope + expiry → reads checked against it → patient can revoke anytime.

  TR -->|acuity score| ENC[EncounterManagement]
  ENC --> CDS[ClinicalDecisionSupport]
  CDS -->|alerts / interactions| ENC
  ENC -->|admit| WARD[WardManagement]
  ENC -->|pregnancy| MAT[Maternity]
  ENC -->|vaccines| IMM[Immunization]
  ENC -->|remote| TELE[Telemedicine]
  ENC --> OF[OperationalFlow]
  OF -->|journey + med reconciliation| DISCH[Discharge]
```

### EncounterManagement
- **Purpose:** Visits, consultations and clinical notes — the unit of clinical work.
- **Importance:** Everything clinical hangs off a visit; it's the spine of the medical record.
- **Services:** `VisitManagementService`, `ConsultationService`.
- **Main flow:** check-in → visit opened → consultation documented (notes, diagnoses, orders) → visit closed → feeds timeline, billing, public health.

### Triage
- **Purpose:** Acuity scoring and emergency-room workflow.
- **Importance:** Decides who is seen first; a safety-critical ordering of care.
- **Services:** `TriageService`, `TriageScoringService`, `EmergencyWorkflowService`.
- **Main flow:** vitals + complaint → acuity score (e.g. ESI) → priority assigned in the queue → emergency cases escalated.

### ClinicalDecisionSupport
- **Purpose:** Real-time clinical alerts, drug-interaction checks, rule evaluation, alert overrides.
- **Importance:** Catches dangerous orders (interactions, allergies, dosing) before they reach the patient.
- **Services:** `ClinicalDecisionSupportService`, `ClinicalAlertService`, `DrugInteractionService`, `RuleEvaluationService`, `AlertOverrideService`.
- **Main flow:** order entered → rules + interaction engine evaluate → alert raised (critical/warning) → clinician acts or overrides-with-reason (logged).

### WardManagement
- **Purpose:** Admissions, bed management and discharge planning.
- **Importance:** Inpatient capacity is finite and life-affecting; bed allocation must be race-safe (uses `lockForUpdate`).
- **Services:** `AdmissionService`, `WardService`, `DischargePlanningService`.
- **Main flow:** admit → bed assigned (locked) → ward rounds → discharge plan → bed freed.

### Maternity
- **Purpose:** Antenatal care and pregnancy/maternity records.
- **Importance:** Maternal mortality is a national KPI; structured ANC drives outcomes + reporting.
- **Services:** `MaternityService`, `AntenatalCareService`.
- **Main flow:** pregnancy registered → ANC visits scheduled + recorded → risk flags → delivery outcome → feeds public-health reporting.

### Immunization
- **Purpose:** Vaccine schedules, administration records and coverage.
- **Importance:** Drives immunization-coverage reporting and AEFI safety surveillance.
- **Services:** `ImmunizationService`.
- **Main flow:** schedule due → dose administered + lot recorded → next dose scheduled → coverage aggregated for PublicHealth.

### Telemedicine
- **Purpose:** Remote consultations, virtual waiting room, tele-consent.
- **Importance:** Extends care to low-access areas; consent + provider routing make it safe and billable.
- **Services:** `TelemedicineService`, `CallProviderService`, `VirtualWaitingRoomService`, `TelemedicineConsentService`.
- **Main flow:** patient requests visit → tele-consent captured → placed in virtual waiting room → provider connects → encounter recorded like any visit.

### OperationalFlow
- **Purpose:** End-to-end patient-journey orchestration + medication reconciliation across transitions.
- **Importance:** Prevents care gaps and medication errors when a patient moves between departments/facilities.
- **Services:** `PatientJourneyService`, `MedicationReconciliationService`, `VisitManagementService`.
- **Main flow:** track each step (arrival→triage→consult→pharmacy→discharge) → reconcile meds at every transition → surface bottlenecks.
